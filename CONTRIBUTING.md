## :thread: How it works

This code is deployed on [Cloudflare worker](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/languages/rust/). The entire script is on lib.rs.
It makes the request exactly as defined by the user, retrieves the response from the target server, and returns it with 
additional headers to ensure it is CORS-compliant.

## :wrench: Tools

While working this project I'm usually using this tools, like:

1. https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com - dummy API
1. https://ngrok.com/ - expose local server
